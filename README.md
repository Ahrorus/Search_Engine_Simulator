## Heapsorted Search Results

>You can search links by keyword, and the list of links is heapsorted by the page ranks,

> Priority Queue of specified size which should be shorter than the page list.

## Priority Queue Methods

> Once priority queue is created, you can use other functionalities. 
> If an exception is ocurred, the program handles it by throwing an error message.
